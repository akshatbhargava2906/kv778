## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

### I am Kartikeya Vishnoi, an undergrad student pursuing a BTech in Computer Engineering. I love using cutting edge tech to solve everyday problems and to automate the boring stuff.

## My current domains of interest are:
### > Deep Learning
### > InfoSec
### > Flutter for app development

## I'm a firm advocate of OpenSource software, and hence all of my projects are OpenSource and freely accessible by everyone.
